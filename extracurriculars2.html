                            <p>During the summer before senior year, students are required to partake in an internship. This internship enables students to engage in real world IT events. Through this internship, students are able to utilize their project management skills and their previous experience with clients from the nonprofit project. This internship gives students a feel for how a career in IT would be. This internship also enables students to practice technical skills that they have learned throughout their CIT courses such as software design and program development.</p>

                                    "For my summer internship, I interned at <strong>Genworth Financial</strong>
                                    . I was selected for GCAS (Genworth Corporate Auditing Services). My task was to automate the generation of reports using SAP Business Objects and the messy MS SQL database that their auditing software, TeamMate, uses. The old system was to use 160 line MS SQL queries to create a table and then paste that result into excel for a VB script to transform it into human-readable output; the end result was a system where columns and other information you wanted in your table could be dragged in, and then it would generate a matching table for you and export it as a PDF."<br>

A couple of years ago, one of our teams went on to win the first-ever Virginia Virtual Datathon hosted by the Chief Data Officer of VA and the Governor; this team also later presented at the Commonwealth of Virginia Information Technology Symposium (COVITS) where they won the People's Choice Award. This year, the CIT Team presented a project relating to COVID-19 at the VA Datathon and garnered an honorable mention from the judges.</p>

                                    <p>The emergence of COVID-19 earlier presented unique challenges to various aspects of daily-life and exacerbated many of the existing inequalities in our society and many of fundamental problems in healthcare and resource-distribution. During the 2020 Datathon, the Deep Run CIT presented a project that focused on the scope and effects of COVID-19 on the collective mental health of people in Virginia. In this project, the team explored the shortage of mental health resources in the commonwealth and presented strategies to alleviate this problem. This project was developed by CIT students Ronojoy D, Abhay S, Adam E, Virinchi T, and Collin R. </p>

                                    <p>BEAST is an app created to compare teacher salary to student performance. It shows how efficiently different schools pay their teachers. BEAST also helps schools adjust their budgets after seeing this correlation. This project was developed by former CIT students Dominic, Lauren, Peyton, Jack, Justin, Tahir, Colin, and Jessica.</p>
