We have groups such as cybersecurity, intermediate programming game design, graphic design, AI, and many more groups. Each of these groups have activities planned by the group leaders, and students get to choose which group they would like to join whether it be something they’re interested in or something that you're just simply curious about. It's a great place to get started or learn more; it's also a great place to meet people who have a common interest or curiosity about those topics. "<br>

I have been in the computer club since my freshman year and experienced many different subgroups such as Programming, Game Design, Cybersecurity, and Artificial Intelligence. All the divisions of the club delve deep into the contents of their topic and really work to expand your knowledge and understanding. Because I also wanted to help other students learn more, I decided to become the lead for Intermediate Programming this year. So far, it has been a great experience for everyone, and hope to keep that up for the rest of the year."<br>
